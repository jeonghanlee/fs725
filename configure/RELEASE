# RELEASE - Location of external support modules

# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

# These modules must be present
